# Instructions for VATIC installation

[VATIC](http://web.mit.edu/vondrick/vatic/) is a free, online, interactive video annotation tool for computer vision research that crowdsources work to Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk. It can be used in offline mode for expert annotator use as well, and is an optimized tool for video annotation.

There is already a default README on their website, but I was unable to install it only following the default instructions, so here I wrote what issues I encountered during installation what I did to install it successfully.

#### Basic configuration of my machine
* Ubuntu 14.04


#### Issues I encountered
1. Packages Missing Problem
 * Before running the downloaded .sh file, you need to take the following steps:<br>
        _sudo apt-get update <br>
        sudo apt-get install python-setuptools<br>
        sudo apt-get install git<br>
        sudo apt-get install build-essential<br>
        sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool pkg-config python-opengl python-imaging pythonpyrex
        python-pyside.qtopengl idle-python2.7 qt4-dev-tools qt4-designer libqtgui4
        libqtcore4 libqt4-xml libqt4-test libqt4-script libqt4-network libqt4-dbus python-qt4
        python-qt4-gl libgle3 python-dev
        sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi<br>
        sudo a2enmod mod-wsgi<br>
        sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb<br>
        sudo easy install munkres<br>
        sudo apt-get install python-pip<br>
        sudo pip install parsedatetime<br>_

 * Then in order to be able to process jpeg files, you also need to install libjpeg-dev with apt:<br>
        _sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev<br>
        pip install -I pillow<br>_

 * Then reinstall pillow:<br>
        _pip install -I pillow_

 * Then you can follow the original instructions to continue.
